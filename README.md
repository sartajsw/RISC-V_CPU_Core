# RISC-V_CPU_Core
Built a simple RISC V CPU Core in Verilog

Used TL-Verilog in the Makerchip platform to build a non-pipelined RISC V processor that supports the RV32I base instruction set.

Followed "Building a RISC-V CPU Core" course by The Linux Foundation.

Future improvements will include implementing the design in traditional Verilog or SystemVerilog and to convert it into a more optimized pipelined design.
